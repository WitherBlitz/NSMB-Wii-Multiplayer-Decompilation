// Deterministic ("lockstep") timing, the base of network play. Copies of the game on different
// devices stay in step only if every guest-visible clock advances identically on all of them, so in
// this mode the time base, VI retraces, audio DMA, OS alarms and sleep timers run on one virtual
// timeline instead of the host's steady clock:
//  * while guest code runs, virtual time stands still apart from a small step per mftb read, so a
//    loop polling the time base still sees it move;
//  * when no guest thread can run, the scheduler moves it straight to the next due event, after
//    waiting for real time to reach that instant.
// Real time only paces the timeline; no guest-visible decision depends on it. The wall-clock pumps
// that deliver retraces, alarms and audio blocks from the middle of GX work or host frame waits are
// off in this mode, since where they land in the guest's execution depends on host speed.
