// Network play, the lobby: rooms before a session starts. A host opens a room on UDP port 52130;
// other devices find it by broadcasting on every local network and by asking Tailscale devices
// directly, since Tailscale carries no broadcasts: the PC's `tailscale status` peers and the known
// devices (KnownDevices). Hosts also announce their room to those devices, and phones listen on
// the room port while looking, so a phone finds a room without knowing its host. Every room answer
// and search passes on the Tailscale devices the sender knows, so all devices on a tailnet that
// run the game learn each other through any one they meet. Starting the room hands every member
// the host's save, waits until all of them have stored it, and tells everyone to restart into the
// session together (netplay_start.h).
