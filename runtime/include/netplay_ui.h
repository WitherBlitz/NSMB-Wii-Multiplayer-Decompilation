//   - a Couch / LAN button at the top right of the file select (Couch by default);
//   - for LAN: "Join" or "Create Room"; Create Room goes on to the game's own player-count screen
//     and then the room, where the host starts or cancels it; Join lists the rooms found on the LAN
//     and over Tailscale;
