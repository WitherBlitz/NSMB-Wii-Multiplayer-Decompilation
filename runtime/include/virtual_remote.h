// New Super Mario Bros. Wii reads nothing but Wii Remotes (held sideways, or with a Nunchuk), so a
// keyboard or an ordinary gamepad has to become one. Every port with no real Wii Remote but with an
// aurora PAD source (an SDL gamepad, or the keyboard when it is switched on for that port in the
// settings overlay) is presented to the game as a bare Wii Remote held sideways: aurora's PADRead
// supplies the GameCube-style state, which picks up the user's button remapping, and Translate()
// turns that into WPAD buttons, a shake and a tilt. Port 1 also always has a built-in keyboard
// layout, so the game is playable without any setup:
//
//   arrows        D-pad (screen directions; rotated for the sideways remote)
//   X / Space     2  (jump, confirm)          Z / Left Shift   1 (run, fireball, back)
//   C / Ctrl      shake (spin jump)           A                A
//   Enter         +  (pause)                  - / Tab          -
//   Q / E         tilt left / right
//
// Gamepads (aurora's default GameCube mapping): left stick or D-pad moves, south button jumps,
// east and west run, north is A, Start is +, Back or left trigger is -, right shoulder or right
// trigger shakes, right stick tilts.
