// Network play, the lockstep part. Every device runs the game in deterministic mode (det_clock.h)
// from power-on and the devices exchange nothing but controller input: each frame's input for every
// player is latched at that frame's VI retrace (frame_input.h), and a device waits there until the
// other players' input for the frame has arrived. Local input is sent `inputDelay` frames ahead, so
// on a LAN the wait is normally zero.
//
// Star topology: clients talk only to the host (player 1), which relays every player's input to
// everyone, so a phone that reaches the PC over Tailscale but not the other phones still plays.
// Packets carry the unacknowledged input history, so a lost datagram costs nothing but a resend.
// Each frame every device also fingerprints one 1/64th slice of guest memory; the host compares
// the slices and reports the first frame two devices disagree on.
