"""Merge aurora pipeline caches (Cache/pipeline_cache.db from devices that played NSMBW) into the
initial_pipeline_cache.db shipped with the game, so a first launch builds the game's shaders up front
instead of stuttering when an effect first appears.

    python make_pipeline_seed.py <out.db> <pipeline_cache.db> [<pipeline_cache.db> ...]

Each input's -wal file must sit next to it (sqlite applies it on open). The rows are portable GX
pipeline descriptions (no compiled code and no game data); aurora merges them into each player's own
cache at startup. Standard library only.
